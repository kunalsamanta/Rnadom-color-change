    <p>What is javaScript event?</p>
    <p>ANS--In JavaScript, an event is an action or occurrence that takes place in the browser, such as a user clicking a button, moving the mouse, typing on the keyboard, or the loading of a web page. JavaScript events are used to trigger specific code or functions in response to these actions, allowing you to create interactive and dynamic web applications.</p>
    <p>can you explain diffrent types of event available in javascript?</p>
    <p>ANS--Click Event,Mouseover Event,Mouseout Event,Keydown Event,Keyup Event,Submit Event</p>
    <p>how is an event triggered or fired</p>
    <p>ANS---The most common way events are triggered is through user interactions, such as clicking, hovering, typing, and scrolling. When a user performs one of these actions, the corresponding event is fired. For example:

        A click event is fired when a user clicks on a button or a link.
        A mouseover event is fired when the mouse cursor moves over an HTML element.
        A keydown event is fired when a key on the keyboard is pressed down.</p>
    <p> differencee between an Event Handler and eventlistenerr?</p>
    <p>ANS-An event handler is a piece of JavaScript code that is directly assigned to an HTML element's attribute. This means the code is written inline within the HTML markup.
        and  Event listeners allow for a cleaner separation of HTML structure (content) and JavaScript behavior (functionality). Event listeners are added to elements from JavaScript code rather than within the HTML markup.

    </p>
    <p >can you give me some examples of HTML Dom event</p>
    <p>Ans--Click Event (click): This event is triggered when an element is clicked with the mouse pointer.</p>
